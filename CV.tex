\section{Education}
	\cventry{2017 -- 2021}{Bachelors degree in Physics with CS minor}{Texas State University}{San Marcos, TX}{3.97 GPA}{Graduated \emph{Summa Cum Laude}, Dean's list every semester}
	\subsection{Notable Coursework}
	\cvlistitem{\emph{Advanced Lab} - Worked in self-guided groups to design and create practical projects, including an automated high-vacuum chamber and a small quadcopter capable of limited autonomous flight. Through thsese projects we learned how to integrate hardware and software components with Arduino and Labview, as well as the basics of PID systems and control loops.}
	\cvlistitem{\emph{Applied Electronics} - Learned the fundamentals of designing and understanding circuits, then applied those to design and create an independent project. My project was a simple coil-gun using a capacitor bank and solenoid to accelerate a projectile, and capable of charging to 1000 volts. Aside from an understanding of circuit design, I also gained experience in soldering, component choice, and working with high voltage.}
	\cvlistitem{\emph{Other Notable Courses} - Electromagnetic Theory I \& II, Calculus III, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Physics, Differential Equations, Assembly Language, Data Structures \& Algorithms}
	
	\cventry{2012 -- 2016}{IB Diploma}{Westwood High School}{Austin, TX}{4.0 GPA}{}

\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{May 2019 -- May 2021}{Lab Tech}{Texas State University}{San Marcos, TX}{}{Worked under Dr. Mark Wistey in Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) research. Resolved technical/mechanical issues and assisted with general ultra-high vacuum lab operation. Also worked alongside him doing guided research using machine learning to analyze spectra.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modified code to allow digital reading of unsupported sensors through Molly control software, as well as debugging and implementing various other hardware control interfaces.
    \item Helped design and build water chiller units with digital controls.
    \item Oversaw transfer of control systems to new hardware and operating systems.
    \item Preformed general maintenance work and operation on ultra-clean systems, ultra-high vacuum systems, high voltage systems, arsenic contaminated systems, and others. 
\end{itemize}}
\cventry{Fall 2021}{Undergraduate Research - Machine Learning}{Texas State University}{San Marcos, TX}{}{Worked as part of a project to identify irregularities in goat blood via spectrography. Implemented a neural network using TensorFlow to categorize the spectral data. The nature of the collected data resulted in machine learning being a poor fit for the processing method, and further research is ongoing}
\cventry{Spring 2020}{Undergraduate Research - FTIR}{Texas State University}{San Marcos, TX}{}{Worked under an advisor to analyze the feasibility of utilizing Fourier Transform Infared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to produce a on-chip component capable of spectorgraphy. While the required materials-science foundataion could not be found to utlize FTIR, a promising technique with a supercapacitor could be an alternative. }


\section{Teaching Experience}
\cventry{Sep 2021 -- Current}{Instructor}{Mathnasium}{Austin, TX}{}{Help students K-12 struggling with math in a tailored curriculum course, as well as one on one instruction}
\cventry{Aug 2021 -- Current}{Online Tutor}{Tutor.com}{}{}{Work with students in science, math, and programing with any probelems on an ad-hoc basis. Highly rated by my students}
\cventry{Aug 2019 -- May 2021}{Learning Assistant/Lab Instructor}{Texas State University}{San Marcos, TX}{}{Worked with various teachers to teach the intro Electricity and Magnetism course and the Advanced Lab course
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taught the fundamentals of electronic and mechanical systems using independent projects including a high-vacuum system and an automated weather station
    \item Learned the pedagogical models backing the Learning Assistant program and modern learning in general
    \item Staffed the physics help center to assist with a variety of problems from various classes.
\end{itemize}}
